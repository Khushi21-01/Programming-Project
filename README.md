## Company Description:
 Nirmitee.io is focused on technology and solutions for the healthcare sector. Nirmitee.io is recognized due to its AI-based digital change, enterprise IT support and product engineering designed for the healthcare industry. The company is creating software that is affordable and suited to Indian SMEs and startups.

 ## Problem Statement:
 Nirmiteeâ€™s digital agency clients currently:  
1.Rely on **disorganized** email/WhatsApp updates for project tracking  
2.Lack **real-time visibility** into task progress 

## Scope of the Project:
 Basic idea for the project is to make a Kanban board for tracking the ongoing tasks. Kanban boards naturally involve Create/Read/Update/Delete operations. Developers can track tasks (To-Do, In Progress, Review, Done). Managers will get real-time progress visibility. It will reduce email/WhatsApp chaos by centralizing work.

## Feature of the project:
- CRUD operations : create , read, update and delete the task  
- Drag and drop status update for tasks  
- Add tasks to different columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)  
- Drag and drop tasks between columns  
- Edit task details (title, description)

## FUNCTIONAL RQUIREMENTS
**CRUD OPERATIONS**:  
1.create : add new task  
2.read: view tasks in kanban   
3.update: update the task progress  
4.delete: delete the task if done
