The company is creating software that is affordable and suited to Indian SMEs and startups.

 ## Problem Statement:
 Nirmiteeâ€™s digital agency clients currently:  
1.Rely on **disorganized** email/WhatsApp updates for project tracking

 Basic idea for the project is to make a Kanban board for tracking the ongoing tasks. Kanban boards naturally involve Create/Read/Update/Delete operations. Developers can track tasks (To-Do, In Progress, Review, Done). Managers will get real-time progress visibility. It will reduce email/WhatsApp chaos by centralizing work.

CRUD operations : create , read, update and delete the task
Drag and drop status update for tasks

## FUNCTIONAL RQUIREMENTS
**CRUD OPERATIONS**:  
1.create : add new task
2.read: view tasks in kanban 
3.update: update the task progress
4.delete: delete the task if done

## NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

**backend** : NodeJs , Express
**database**: MongoDB 
**Architecture** : API integration
